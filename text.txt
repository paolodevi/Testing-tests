Perfect — yes, that’s actually the cleanest and most modular way to do it.

You already have your plotting handled by your custom plotter_c function, and it returns handles to the figure and axes, like this:

[figs_axes(i).fig, figs_axes(i).ax] = plotter_c(ref{i}, tgt{i}, ref{i}.pair.n2n, 6, 0);

So what we’ll do is:

1. Keep your existing logic that calls plotter_c for each case.


2. Do not replot anything manually.


3. Simply copy all graphics objects (Children) from those existing axes handles into the new UIAxes in your UIFigure.



That way:

You get the same plots you already generate.

The new interface remains fully interactive.

You don’t have to rewrite your plotting logic.

✅ Here’s the fixed portion of the script

This replaces the middle of the script in the mainUI function (the plotting part only).
Everything else from the previous version stays the same.

% --- Generate original figures (your plots) ---
    figs_axes = struct();
    for i = 1:3
        [figs_axes(i).fig, figs_axes(i).ax] = plotter_c(ref{i}, tgt{i}, ref{i}.pair.n2n, 6, 0);
    end

    % --- Create UIFigure ---
    fig = uifigure('Name','Configs Matching','Position',[100 100 1200 600]);

    % --- Create grid layout ---
    gl = uigridlayout(fig,[2 3]);
    gl.RowHeight = {'2x','1x'};
    gl.ColumnWidth = {'1x','1x','1x'};

    % --- Top row: create UIAxes and copy existing plots ---
    axUI = gobjects(1,3);
    for i = 1:3
        axUI(i) = uiaxes(gl);
        axUI(i).Layout.Row = 1;
        axUI(i).Layout.Column = i;

        % Copy all graphical content from your original axes
        if isvalid(figs_axes(i).ax)
            copyobj(allchild(figs_axes(i).ax), axUI(i));
        end

        % Apply axis limits and title
        try
            xlim(axUI(i), xlim(figs_axes(i).ax));
            ylim(axUI(i), ylim(figs_axes(i).ax));
        catch
            xlim(axUI(i), [0 20]);
        end
        title(axUI(i), sprintf('%s / %s', ...
            ref{i}.case.input, ref{i}.case.output));

        % Make sure interaction works
        hold(axUI(i),'on');
        zoom(axUI(i).Parent,'on');
        pan(axUI(i).Parent,'on');
    end

🔧 Where to insert this

In the previous version I sent, replace this block:

% --- Top row: UIAxes for interactive plots ---
axUI = gobjects(1,3);
for i = 1:3
    axUI(i) = uiaxes(gl);
    ...
end

% --- Copy original plots into UIAxes ---
for i = 1:3
    ...
end

with the new version above.

Everything else — including the arrayEditorUI and bottom panel — stays exactly as before.


---

✅ Result

You still call your original plotter_c function exactly as before.

Your existing figures and axes are reused.

Their contents are copied into the new interactive UIAxes.

No layout or compatibility issues.

You can pan, zoom, rotate, etc. inside the UI.

Would you like me to send the fully merged complete script (with this snippet integrated into the working version from before)?
That will give you a single ready-to-run .m file.
