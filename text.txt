Absolutely ‚úÖ ‚Äî MATLAB makes it straightforward to save your animation as a GIF, and it works perfectly with the patch-based animation you already have.

Let‚Äôs go step by step üëá

üéûÔ∏è Add GIF saving to your animation loop

Below is a template you can wrap around your existing animation code (no matter if it‚Äôs a standalone or part of your big script):

% === GIF SETTINGS ===
gif_filename = 'mode_animation.gif';  % output filename
delay_time = 0.02;                    % frame delay in seconds (~50 FPS)
loop_count = inf;                     % repeat forever

% === (OPTIONAL) remove existing file ===
if isfile(gif_filename)
    delete(gif_filename);
end

% === ANIMATION LOOP ===
for i = 1:length(t)
    % ... your existing animation update code ...
    % e.g.
    %   V = V0 + scale * dV * sin(omega * t(i));
    %   set(hPatch, 'Vertices', V);

    drawnow;

    % --- Capture frame and write to GIF ---
    frame = getframe(gcf);  % capture current figure
    [imind, cm] = rgb2ind(frame2im(frame), 256);  % convert to indexed image

    if i == 1
        imwrite(imind, cm, gif_filename, 'gif', ...
                'Loopcount', loop_count, 'DelayTime', delay_time);
    else
        imwrite(imind, cm, gif_filename, 'gif', ...
                'WriteMode', 'append', 'DelayTime', delay_time);
    end
end

disp(['‚úÖ GIF saved as ', gif_filename]);

üí° Notes and Tips

getframe(gcf) captures the current figure window exactly as displayed.

Adjust delay_time to control playback speed in the GIF.

Loopcount = inf makes the GIF loop indefinitely ‚Äî set it to 1 for single playthrough.

If your animation flickers or you see background issues, try adding:

set(gcf, 'Renderer', 'zbuffer');

before the loop (it‚Äôs often more stable for 3D patches).

üß† Example integration

Say your animation code looks like this:

for i = 1:length(t)
    V = V0 + scale * dV * sin(omega * t(i));
    set(hPatch, 'Vertices', V);
    drawnow;
end

Just change it to:

for i = 1:length(t)
    V = V0 + scale * dV * sin(omega * t(i));
    set(hPatch, 'Vertices', V);
    drawnow;
    
    % Capture and write GIF frame
    frame = getframe(gcf);
    [imind, cm] = rgb2ind(frame2im(frame), 256);
    if i == 1
        imwrite(imind, cm, 'mode_animation.gif', 'gif', ...
                'Loopcount', inf, 'DelayTime', 0.02);
    else
        imwrite(imind, cm, 'mode_animation.gif', 'gif', ...
                'WriteMode', 'append', 'DelayTime', 0.02);
    end
end

Would you like me to modify your existing animation function (the one with patch('Faces', Faces, 'Vertices', ...)) to automatically save the GIF too?
That way you can call it like:

animate_mode_patch(Faces, V0, V1, f, scale, nCycles, nFrames, 'savegif', true);

and it would do everything in one go.
